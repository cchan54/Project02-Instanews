# Project02-Instanews

<h3>The function of the Instanews webpage:<h3>
<p>Based on user selection, quickly fetch and filter recent news stories from the "New York Times" Top Stories API, populating them as ages with short abstracts in the webpage.</p>
<p>Link each news image to the news URL on the New York Times website.</p>
<p>Resize Instanews header and footer so that it transitions from occupying the entire screen on page load to a better view with news populated.</p>

<h3>Technologies used and personal learnings:</h3>
HTML: For this project, HTML was a minimal as most of what's populating the page was written in Javascript
SCSS: I found that SASS is much quicker and simpler, both writing and reviewing, than plain CSS
Javascript:
JQuery:
AJAX:
Font Faces:
Node.js:
GULP (uglify, rename, auto-prefixer, sass, eslint, watchdog, browser-sync, css-nano, pretty-error)
